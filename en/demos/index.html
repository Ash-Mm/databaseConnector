                    <p1>The <b>overall objective</b> of the project is to provide the Mediterranean horticultural community with <b>innovative tools to enable resource efficient year round greenhouse cultivation</b> by harnessing the potential of both simple and advanced technologies for smart nutrient, irrigation & climate control, and integrated pest management taking into account their feasibility and cost-effectiveness at individual greenhouse level. </p1>

                    <p1>To achieve this overall objective the project is targeted at the following <b>Specific Objectives (SO)</b>:</p1>
                    <p2><b>SO1</b>- To develop and test a user-friendly and flexible Decision Support System (DSS) allowing <b>smart nutrient, irrigation & climate control, and integrated pest management</b> in greenhouses through:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Expert advisory services to help farmers in intensive knowledge tasks where climatic, crop and nutrient variables decisively influence crop growth and productivity (precise water & fertilisers’ needs, efficient climate control…)</li>
                        <li>Efficient and cost-effective partial or full automation of greenhouses (fertigation, ventilation, heating, etc.)</li>
                    </ul></p2>
                    <p2><b>SO2</b>- To demonstrate the potential of <b>biological agro-ecological technologies to close the loop in Mediterranean greenhouses</b> by validating aquaponics systems based on the combination of IMTA and hydroponics to deliver high quality Mediterranean horticultural and fish products with improved WUE and NUE.</p2>
                    <p2><b>SO3</b>- To provide farmers with tools for <b>environmentally friendly integrated pest management</b> in horticultural greenhouses by testing bio-based pest management tactics for effective pest control in horticultural greenhouses.</p2>
                    <p2><b>SO4</b>- <b>To validate HortiMED technologies in low, medium and high technology greenhouses from Egypt, Algeria and Spain</b> and conduct a socioeconomic and environmental analysis of the technologies through Life Cycle Assessment and Cost-Benefit analyses.</p2>
                    <p2><b>SO5</b>- To achieve well-targeted communication and <b>effective transfer of the project results</b> to stakeholders to successfully embed the HortiMED results into local horticultural community systems.</p2>
